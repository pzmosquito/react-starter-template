## FAQ

- ##### Why all the technologies? I just need React.
  You are right, you don't need any of the listed technologies other than React itself to build a React application. However, additional tools will help us code much more efficiently.

- ##### I still think the standard list is too long.
  You can remove the following:  
    - `LESS`, `PostCSS` - If you use plain CSS.
    - `ESLint`, `EditorConfig` - If you and your team are very consistent with your coding style, or don't care much.
    - `Flow` - If you don't want to do type checking.
